      "**Executive Summary**\n",
      "NVIDIA, AMD, and Google (Alphabet) are the top three AI chip companies in 2024, each leveraging distinct competitive advantages. NVIDIA dominates with over 70% of AI semiconductor sales, AMD offers cost-effective solutions, and Google excels in custom AI chip development for its ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings**\n",
      "- NVIDIA leads the AI chip market with over 70% of AI semiconductor sales, benefiting from years of innovation and technology leadership [1][5].\n",
      "- AMD positions itself as a cost-effective and high-performance alternative, with products like the Instinct MI300X accelerator featuring 192GB of HBM3 memory [4][9].\n",
      "- Google (Alphabet) is a major player, producing its own AI chips and competing with traditional chip makers in innovation and technology [1][4].\n",
      "- Traditional chip makers like NVIDIA, AMD, AVGO, and INTC are expected to have an edge over data center/search companies in innovation and technology due to their extensive experience [1][5].\n",
      "- The AI chip market is driven by extensive R&D spending and investment, with companies focusing on improving chip architecture and software optimization [2][6].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "NVIDIA, AMD, and Google are the top AI chip companies in 2024, each with unique strengths: NVIDIA's market dominance, AMD's cost-effectiveness, and Google's custom chip development. The market remains highly competitive, with traditional chip makers maintaining an edge in innovation.\n"

    "- **State management**: write down what the agent knows (inputs/outputs) and pass it explicitly.\n",
    "- **Context management**: keep prompts short and structured; include only what is necessary; summarize when needed.\n",
    "- **Memory (optional)**: decide what should persist across runs (none vs. per-session vs. long-term).\n",
